# Kubernetes Development Environment

This is a [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) project that does the following:

- Provisions AWS infrastructure
  - ec2 instance
  - security group
  - ssh keypair

- Creates [k3d](https://k3d.io/) cluster on the ec2 instance
- Sets up the cluster for remote access from your local machine

This is built on and for macOS

- go `1.19`

- [pulumi cli](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/) -- `brew install pulumi`
